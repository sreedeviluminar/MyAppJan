        Malayalam superstar Mammootty’s latest film
        The Priest released in the rest of India on Friday,
        a week after it made its theatrical debut in Kerala and a
        few other overseas markets. The film has already earned quite a
        reputation as an engaging horror thriller, having received largely
        positive reviews. The film’s box office collection has been solid despite
        people being wary of visiting cinemas during Covid-19 pandemic.
        However, I was underwhelmed after watching the film as it did not meet all
        the expectations that I had built up in my head. I was also in confusion as
        I wondered whether I was tripped by my high expectations, courtesy the film’s
        critical and commercial success in Kerala, or the film in itself was average?
        After sleeping on it, I have concluded that The Priest is not as good as it
        was marketed to be. The film, with some exciting ideas, was mediocre at best.
        The Priest follows the adventures of Fr Carmen Benedict, (played by Mammootty),
        as he hops from one mystery to another. Every case he takes up is a Pandora’s box,
        that brings forth a slew of unresolved mysteries and unhappy ghosts. He is called in
        to investigate a series of suicides within the same family that takes place under
        mysterious circumstances. Just when you think this is the case this movie is all about,
        debutant director Jofin T Chacko throws in his first twist. The sensational case was
        just an excuse to draw Benedict into a web of dark deception. While investigating the
        suicides, Benedict runs into Ameya Gabriel (Baby Monica) and instantly feels something
        is off about this 11-year-old girl. “She is carrying a massive weight, which is not of
        her own,” Benedict tells his cop friend after his senses capture some paranormal presence
        in the atmosphere.
